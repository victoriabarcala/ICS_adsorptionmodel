# ICS_adsorptionmodel
Files to run the adsorption model
The function that solves the ODE needs to be run (P_column.R). The solution for a constant velocity and variable velocity is included. The input files of column I (Column_B.R), II (Column_A.R), and III (Column_C.R) are attached with the corresponding data files. The velocity, initial concentration, filter height, and porosity can be modified to model/predict different situations.
