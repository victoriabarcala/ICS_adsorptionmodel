# ICS_adsorptionmodel
The function that solves the ODE needs to be run (P_column_k.R) first. The solution for a constant velocity and variable velocity is included in Model_ICS_Script.R. The input files of column I, II, and III are available in the GitHub repository (https://github.com/victoriabarcala/ICS_adsorptionmodel) ready to import to the R script. The velocity, initial concentration, filter height, and porosity can be modified to model/predict different situations.
